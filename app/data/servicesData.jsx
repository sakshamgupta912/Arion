  <p className="mb-4">
    Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) is a cancer treatment that uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. At low doses, radiation is used in x-rays to see inside your body, as with x-rays of your teeth or broken bones.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">How Radiation Therapy Works Against Cancer</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    At high doses, radiation therapy kills cancer cells or slows their growth by damaging their DNA. Cancer cells whose DNA is damaged beyond repair stop dividing or die. When the damaged cells die, they are broken down and removed by the body.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Radiation therapy does not kill cancer cells right away. It takes days or weeks of treatment before DNA is damaged enough for cancer cells to die. Then, cancer cells keep dying for weeks or months after radiation therapy ends.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Types of Radiation Therapy</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">There are two main types of radiation therapy:</p>
  <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
    <li>External beam</li>
    <li>Internal beam</li>
  </ol>
  <p className="mb-4">The type of radiation therapy that you may have depends on many factors, including:</p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>The type of cancer</li>
    <li>The size of the tumor</li>
    <li>The tumorâ€™s location in the body</li>
    <li>How close the tumor is to normal tissues that are sensitive to radiation</li>
    <li>Your general health and medical history</li>
    <li>Whether you will have other types of cancer treatment</li>
    <li>Other factors, such as your age and other medical conditions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-4">External Beam Radiation Therapy</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">
    External beam radiation therapy comes from a machine that aims radiation at your cancer. The machine is large and may be noisy. It does not touch you, but can move around you, sending radiation to a part of your body from many directions.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    External beam radiation therapy is a local treatment, which means it treats a specific part of your body. For example, if you have cancer in your lung, you will have radiation only to your chest, not to your whole body.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-4">Internal Radiation Therapy</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Internal radiation therapy is a treatment in which a source of radiation is put inside your body. The radiation source can be solid or liquid.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Internal radiation therapy with a solid source is called brachytherapy. In this type of treatment, seeds, ribbons, or capsules that contain a radiation source are placed in your body, in or near the tumor. Like external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy is a local treatment and treats only a specific part of your body.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Internal radiation therapy with a liquid source is called systemic therapy. Systemic means that the treatment travels in the blood to tissues throughout your body, seeking out and killing cancer cells. You receive systemic radiation therapy by swallowing, through a vein via an IV line, or through an injection.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    With systemic radiation, your body fluids, such as urine, sweat, and saliva, will give off radiation for a while.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Why People with Cancer Receive Radiation Therapy</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Radiation therapy is used to treat cancer and ease cancer symptoms. When used to treat cancer, radiation therapy can cure cancer, prevent it from returning, or stop or slow its growth.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    When treatments are used to ease symptoms, they are known as palliative treatments. External beam radiation may shrink tumors to treat pain and other problems caused by the tumor, such as trouble breathing or loss of bowel and bladder control.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Pain from cancer that has spread to the bone can be treated with systemic radiation therapy drugs called radiopharmaceuticals.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Types of Cancer Treated with Radiation Therapy</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    External beam radiation therapy is used to treat many types of cancer. Brachytherapy is most often used to treat cancers of the head and neck, breast, cervix, prostate, and eye.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    A systemic radiation therapy called radioactive iodine, or I-131, is most often used to treat certain types of thyroid cancer.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Another type of systemic radiation therapy, called targeted radionuclide therapy, is used to treat some patients who have advanced prostate cancer or gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET). This type of treatment may also be referred to as molecular radiotherapy.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">How Radiation Is Used with Other Cancer Treatments</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    For some people, radiation may be the only treatment you need. But, most often, you will have radiation therapy with other cancer treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Radiation therapy may be given before, during, or after these other treatments to improve the chances that treatment will work.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    When radiation is combined with surgery, it can be given:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>Before surgery, to shrink the size of the cancer so it can be removed by surgery and be less likely to return.</li>
    <li>During surgery, so that it goes straight to the cancer without passing through the skin. Radiation therapy used this way is called intraoperative radiation.</li>
    <li>After surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Lifetime Dose Limits</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    There is a limit to the amount of radiation an area of your body can safely receive over the course of your lifetime. Depending on how much radiation an area has already been treated with, you may not be able to have radiation therapy to that area a second time.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Radiation Therapy Can Cause Side Effects</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Radiation not only kills or slows the growth of cancer cells, it can also affect nearby healthy cells. Damage to healthy cells can cause side effects.

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">How Much Radiation Therapy Costs</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Radiation therapy can be expensive. It uses complex machines and involves the services of many health care providers. The exact cost of your radiation therapy depends on the cost of health care where you live, what type of radiation therapy you get, and how many treatments you need.

  <p className="mb-4">
    Nuclear medicine is a medical specialty that uses radioactive tracers
    (radiopharmaceuticals) to assess bodily functions and to diagnose and treat
    disease. Specially designed cameras allow doctors to track the path of
    these radioactive tracers.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4">
    Nuclear medicine is a specialized area of radiology. It uses very small
    amounts of a radioactive substance (radionuclide or radio-tracer) for
    health research, diagnosis, and treatment of various conditions, including
    cancer. Nuclear medicine imaging is a mix of many different disciplines,
    including chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer technology, and
    medicine.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4">
    Soft tissue, such as intestines, muscles, and blood vessels, is hard to see
    on a standard X-ray unless a contrast agent is used. This agent allows the
    tissue to be seen more clearly. Nuclear imaging shows organ and tissue
    structure as well as function. The extent to which a radionuclide is
    absorbed, or "taken up," by a certain organ or tissue may even show how
    well the organ or tissue is working. So, while diagnostic X-rays are used
    mainly to study anatomy, nuclear imaging is used to study organ and tissue
    function.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Radionuclides and Imaging</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    A tiny amount of the radionuclide is used during the procedure. The
    radionuclide is also known as a radiopharmaceutical or radioactive tracer.
    It is absorbed by body tissue. There are several different types of
    radionuclides, including forms of the elements technetium, thallium,
    gallium, iodine, and xenon. The type of radionuclide used will depend on the
    type of study and the body part being checked.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    After the radionuclide has been given and has collected in the body tissue
    under study, radiation will be given off. A radiation detector can pick up
    this radiation. The most common type of detector is the gamma camera.
    Digital signals are made and stored by a computer when the gamma camera
    detects the radiation.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Diagnosing with Nuclear Scans</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    With a nuclear scan, healthcare providers can assess and diagnose many
    conditions, such as tumors, infections, or organ enlargement. A nuclear
    scan may also be used to check organ function and blood circulation.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    The areas where the radionuclide collects in greater amounts are called
    "hot spots." The areas that don't absorb the radionuclide are called "cold
    spots." These appear less bright on the scan image.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    In planar imaging, the gamma camera stays still, and the resulting images
    are 2-D. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) makes detailed
    images of an organ as the gamma camera moves around you, similar to a CT
    scan. In certain cases, such as PET scans, 3-D images can be done using the
    SPECT data.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Common Nuclear Medicine Tests</h2>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>
      <strong>Renal scans:</strong> These look at the kidneys and may find
      problems with function or obstructions in blood flow.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Thyroid scans:</strong> These check how the thyroid is working or
      examine thyroid nodules or masses.
    </li>
    <li>
